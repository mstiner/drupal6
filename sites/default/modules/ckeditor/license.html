  <p>You should carefully read the following terms and conditions before using, installing, copying, or distributing the Software. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by CKSource, your use, installation, copying, or distribution of the Software indicates your acceptance of this License.</p>
  <p>3. Scope of License</p>
  <p>All rights of any kind to the Software which are not expressly granted in this Agreement are entirely and exclusively reserved to and by CKSource. The Software is protected by applicable national and international laws and treaties.</p>
  <p>You may use, install, copy, and distribute the Software solely as expressly provided in this Agreement. You may not rent, lease, loan, sublicense, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on the Software, in whole or in part, nor permit anyone else to do so.</p>
  <p>It is agreed that in exchange for the license set forth herein, you will pay a onetime license fee (“License Fee”). The fee value will be specified by CKSource at the moment of the purchase.</p>

  <ul><li><span>a) </span>(“Website”) Installing the Software on a single Drupal Website (“Site”). The Site URL (“URL”) must be specified at the moment of the purchase. The license will not be valid for sub-domains of the specified URL. This license includes 5 Developer licenses that cover Development Activities exclusively related to the Site.</li>

  <p>License Fees values may differ depending on the license model.</p>
  <p>5. Unlicensed Copies</p>
  <p>If you did not pay for a license, you may use unlicensed copies of the Software for the exclusive purpose of demonstration. In this case you will be using the Software in the "demo mode". Without derogating from the forgoing, you may not use the Software in the "demo mode" for commercial purposes. The Software shall only be used for evaluation purposes and may not be used or disclosed for any other purposes, including without limitation, for external distribution, or for software development. You may not remove demo notices from the interface nor disable the ability to display such notices or otherwise modify the Software. Product support, if any, is not offered for the Software in the "demo mode".</p>
  <p>The Software may be automatically blocked and totally stop working after a certain period of time running in the “demo mode”. It is not allowed to extend the demo mode in such case and a valid license must be purchased to unblock the Software.</p>
  <p>6. Agreement Acceptance</p>
  <p>This Agreement is automatically accepted by both parties as long as You are in possession of a legal evidence (“Legal Evidence”) that the acceptance has taken place. The Legal Evidence can be represented by (i) an agreement signed by You and CKSource stating the acceptance of this Agreement or (ii) a valid Certificate of License Ownership, provided by CKSource and addressed to You. The Legal Evidence must precisely indicate this Agreement Name, the Software Name, and the License Model chosen.</p>
  <p>Legal Evidences may define further rights and limitation terms that are not described in this Agreement. Any term present in the Agreement that goes in conflict with the Legal Evidence terms is to be deleted or amended.</p>
  <p>Legal Evidences for the Website License Model are not transferable to different Websites.</p>
  <p>7. Limitation on Releases</p>
